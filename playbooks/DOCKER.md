# Docker Playbook

## Purpose

Defines Docker containerization patterns, clean build requirements, and deployment standards for Ascendvent AI-assisted development projects.

---

## üß™ MANDATORY Testing Protocol (NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Clean Docker Build Requirement:**

```bash
# MANDATORY for ALL code changes (NEVER use restart)
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

## üê≥ Docker-based Development and Deployment

### Development

* Local builds use docker-compose for full stack simulation
* Services include frontend, backend, Firebase emulator, and PostgreSQL
* All local builds must be clean
### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Rebuild vs Restart Decision Matrix

| Change Type | Required Action | Reason |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Code changes (TypeScript, server, client) | REBUILD | Code must be recompiled/bundled |
| Environment variables | REBUILD | New vars need container restart with rebuild |
| Package.json dependencies | REBUILD | Dependencies must be installed |
| Docker configuration | REBUILD | Container structure changed |
| Database schema | Restart only | Database runs independently |
| Config files only | Restart only | No code compilation needed |

üö´ **NEVER** use `docker-compose restart` for code changes - it won't apply your changes!

### ‚úÖ Local Clean Build Sequence (MANDATORY for code changes)

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

## üìä Post-Rebuild Verification Protocol

After every rebuild, MUST verify changes took effect:

```bash
# 1. Check all services are healthy
docker-compose ps

# 2. Verify health endpoint
curl -sf http://localhost:3000/api/health

# 3. Check app logs for startup messages
docker-compose logs app --tail=20

# 4. Check database logs for connection health
docker-compose logs postgres --tail=10

# 5. Look for your new debug logs/changes
docker-compose logs app | grep -i "your-new-feature"
```

## üîç Log Monitoring During Development

Always monitor logs during testing to catch issues early:

```bash
# Monitor real-time logs for both services
docker-compose logs -f app postgres

# Filter out health check noise
docker-compose logs app | grep -v "GET /api/health"

# Check for authentication/database errors
docker-compose logs app | grep -i "error\|auth\|database"

# Verify database connections
docker-compose logs postgres | grep -i "connection\|error"
```

## Best Practices

**DO:**
* Use clean builds for all code changes
* Monitor logs during development
* Verify health endpoints after rebuild
* Use proper table formatting for decision matrices

**DON'T:**
* Use `docker-compose restart` for code changes
* Skip verification steps after rebuild
* Ignore container health status
* Mix restart and rebuild commands
