# CLAUDE.md ‚Äì Global Policy (Stack-agnostic)

## üìå Purpose

This is Ascendvent LLC's global Claude agent behavior specification that applies across all company projects.

This document defines technical constraints, coding standards, SDLC protocols, testing requirements, bug management procedures, documentation standards, Claude Flow agent enforcement, telemetry and cost controls, and systematic workflow expectations for AI-assisted development.

## üö® CRITICAL: Anti-Urgency Bias Protocols

**NEVER BYPASS SYSTEMATIC APPROACH**  
Urgency does NOT justify protocol violations.

### MANDATORY Pre-Action Checklist
- [ ] **STOP**: Before any action, reference CLAUDE.md requirements
- [ ] **CHECK**: Is this covered by existing agents? Use agents first
- [ ] **TEST**: Run the project's test checklist for ANY code changes
- [ ] **REBUILD**: As required by the project's stack
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Each step must pass before proceeding

### FORBIDDEN Urgency Shortcuts
- ‚ùå "Quick fixes" without testing
- ‚ùå Direct code changes without agent usage check
- ‚ùå Skipping compilation or build checks required by the stack
- ‚ùå Bypassing systematic debugging methodology

### Process Violation = IMMEDIATE STOP
Any deviation from these protocols requires stopping all work and returning to proper methodology.

---

## ü§ñ MANDATORY Agent Usage Before Direct Action

### Agent-First Rule
If an agent exists for the task, **USE THE AGENT**. Do not bypass agents for direct implementation.

### BEFORE Making Any Changes
Check if covered by agents:

#### Research Agent (SPEC-009)
- **MUST use** for any research tasks
- Evidence-based methodology research
- Technical architecture pattern analysis
- **Usage**: `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` with research capabilities

#### Available Claude Flow Agents
**MUST check availability before direct implementation**
- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init`
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate`
- `mcp__claude-flow__github_workflow_auto`
- `mcp__claude-flow__neural_train`

### Agent Usage Protocol
1. Identify task type
2. Check agent availability
3. Use appropriate agent with proper parameters
4. Only proceed directly if no agent covers the task type

---

## üß™ MANDATORY Testing Protocol (NO EXCEPTIONS)

### Before ANY Code Change
1. **ALWAYS** run the project's full testing checklist FIRST
2. **VERIFY** all tests pass before proceeding
3. **NO CODE CHANGES** without passing tests

### Testing Violations = IMMEDIATE STOP
- Any failing test blocks progress
- Coverage below the global bar blocks deployment
- Compilation or build errors block changes
- Automated or manual loop warnings block changes

### Clean Build Requirement
Follow the project's stack playbook for rebuild rules and health checks.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è PROCESS COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT

### Claude Behavior Requirements
- Reference CLAUDE.md before EVERY action
- Use agents FIRST before direct implementation
- Run testing checklist for ANY code changes
- Follow the stack playbook for rebuild rules
- Systematic debugging following Component ‚Üí Hook ‚Üí Dependency methodology

### Violation Prevention Checklist
- [ ] Protocol check
- [ ] Agent availability verification
- [ ] Testing requirement confirmation
- [ ] Documentation update verification
- [ ] Rebuild protocol followed

### Compliance Verification
Each action must reference which CLAUDE.md protocol is being followed and why the systematic approach is used.

---

## üõ† Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use strict typing and linters if the stack supports them
- Follow repository linters and formatters
- Prefer functional patterns when practical

---

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing and Bug Management

### Test-Driven Development Workflow
- Write tests first
- Unit tests at agreed coverage bar
- Integration tests for component and API interactions
- Build test using the stack's build system
- Manual end-to-end tests for complete user flows
- Performance checks appropriate to the stack

### Pre-Commit Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests with coverage
- [ ] Compilation or type checks if applicable
- [ ] Clean build using the stack rules
- [ ] Health verification for the service
- [ ] Authentication or permissions flow validated if applicable
- [ ] Manual smoke test of key flows

### ‚ö° Performance & Loop Detection
- Console warnings monitored
- Component re-render checks where applicable
- Hook or callback stability checks where applicable
- Memory usage observed during idle
- API request patterns monitored for rapid-fire repeats
- UI responsiveness verified after interactions

---

## üêõ Bug Management

### Bug Creation and Tracking
- Test creation on every feature branch
- E2E checklists for major workflows
- Performance tests for auth or state management changes
- Regression tests for every fix
- Target coverage per PR

### Bug Logging Requirements
- Log bugs with reproduction steps, environment, severity
- Include failing test that reproduces the issue
- Fixes reference bug ID in commit message
- Use hotfix branches for critical issues

### Bug Severity Matrix
- **Critical**: Blocks production. Requires regression test
- **High**: Breaks key features. Fix next sprint. Requires regression test
- **Medium**: Affects non critical flows. Log and schedule. Test recommended
- **Low**: Minor or cosmetic. Backlog. Optional test

---

## üîÑ Testing-First Development Process

### For New Features
1. Write failing E2E test
2. Write failing unit tests
3. Implement to green
4. Rebuild per stack rules
5. Verify via logs and functionality testing
6. Run full checklist
7. Deploy only after all tests pass

### For Bug Fixes
1. Create failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix to green
3. Rebuild per stack rules
4. Verify fix with logs and manual testing
5. Run regression suite
6. Run full checklist
7. Update bug documentation

### üö® Never Ship Without Tests
- No PR merges without passing suite and log verification
- No deployments without clean build verification and health checks
- No auth changes without loop prevention checks and log monitoring
- No performance-critical changes without regression tests and performance analysis
- No code changes without proper rebuild and change verification

---

## üîç Mandatory Testing + Logging Protocol

Every test includes log monitoring steps appropriate to the stack:
1. Clean rebuild per stack rules
2. Run test
3. Check logs for errors and warnings
4. Verify expected behavior in logs

---

## üîÑ Dependency Stability & Infinite Loop Prevention

### Critical Patterns
- Avoid unstable dependencies in effects and callbacks
- Avoid dynamic values in initialization that cause recreation loops
- Memoize returned functions in custom hooks if using a hook-based UI stack

### Detection Techniques
- Console warnings
- Network tab for rapid-fire identical requests
- Performance tab for excessive render cycles
- Memory tab for rising usage

### Log-Based Detection
- Search logs for repetitive render or effect patterns
- Search for rapid identical API calls
- Search for loop warnings

### Debugging Loop Root Causes
1. Identify loop source
2. Trace dependency chain
3. Verify fix with clean rebuild per stack
4. Monitor logs to confirm the loop is eliminated

### Dependency Stability Checklist
- [ ] No dynamic values in initialization calls that recreate behavior
- [ ] Stable dependencies only
- [ ] Memoized returns from custom utilities where applicable
- [ ] No object or array literals in dependency lists
- [ ] Rebuilt clean and monitored logs
- [ ] No loop warnings in console

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Verification Protocol

### Mandatory Data Inspection for API Development
Verify that persistence works correctly.

### Requirements
- Verify required entities exist
- Check schema matches expectations
- Check state before API call
- Make the call
- Verify data changes after the call
- Test persistence across refreshes and sessions

### Critical Rule
If an API returns success but data verification shows no change, the API is broken and must be fixed before proceeding.

### üîó Mandatory Pairing Rule
API testing must be paired with data state inspection. Do not test endpoints in isolation.

---

## üîç Enhanced Change Verification Protocol

After any change and rebuild verify the change took effect.

### Verify Build Succeeded
- Check compilation or build logs for success
- Look for new debug messages in logs
- Verify new endpoints or changes work
- Check data for expected changes

### Stack-Specific Verification
- Run type checks if applicable
- Check for framework warnings
- Verify hot reload events in development if applicable
- Verify component or module re-renders show expected behavior

### Rollback if Changes Not Applied
- Force clean rebuild per stack rules
- Verify health and logs again

### Troubleshoot Common Issues
- Code changes not applied ‚Üí rebuild per stack rules
- Compilation errors ‚Üí check build logs
- Hot reload not working ‚Üí verify dev mode
- Connection issues ‚Üí check service logs
- Schema changes not applied ‚Üí verify migrations
- Missing env ‚Üí verify config and rebuild

### Success Indicators
- Clean build and logs
- New behavior visible in logs
- No loop patterns
- UI or service reflects new behavior
- Backend and frontend integrate properly if present
- State updates work as expected

---

## üêõ Bug Investigation and Resolution Workflow

### STOP-DOCUMENT-ANALYZE Protocol

#### STOP

  - Hit health endpoints if applicable

- Auth Issues
  - Check auth service logs
  - Verify tokens or sessions
  - Check middleware logs

- Data Issues
  - Check database or storage connection
  - Check recent migrations or schema updates

- API Issues
