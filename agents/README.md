## 🎯 Agent Overview

Our streamlined agent team consists of:

### **Core Development (4 agents)**
- **`development-agent`** - Full-stack React/Node.js/TypeScript implementation
- **`quality-agent`** - Code analysis, refactoring, and review
- **`test-agent`** - Comprehensive testing with TDD and coverage enforcement  
- **`research-agent`** - Multi-domain research for evidence-based development

### **Process & Methodology (2 agents)**
- **`sparc-agent`** - SPARC methodology coordination (Spec → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Completion)
- **`github-workflow`** - Complete GitHub workflow management (PRs, branches, validation)

### **Operations & Support (4 agents)**

## 🚀 Usage Patterns

### Task-to-Agent Mapping

**Feature Development:**
1. `research-agent` → Requirements and evidence gathering
2. `sparc-agent` → Process coordination through SPARC phases
3. `development-agent` → Implementation with React/Node.js/TypeScript
4. `test-agent` → TDD and comprehensive testing
5. `quality-agent` → Code review and refactoring
6. `github-workflow` → PR management and merge validation

**Bug Fixes:**
1. `quality-agent` → Root cause analysis and refactoring plan
2. `development-agent` → Implementation with proper patterns
3. `test-agent` → Regression testing and validation
4. `github-workflow` → Quick PR validation and merge

**Operations:**
1. `build-monitor` → CI/CD validation and health checks
2. `security-ops` → Security scanning and spend monitoring
3. `release-ops` → Version management and deployment

### Agent Invocation Examples

```bash
# Feature development workflow
claude-flow agent development-agent "Implement user authentication with Firebase"
claude-flow agent test-agent "Create comprehensive test suite for auth system"
claude-flow agent quality-agent "Review authentication implementation for security patterns"

# Bug analysis and fix
claude-flow agent quality-agent "Analyze infinite loop in useAssessment hook"
claude-flow agent development-agent "Fix React hook stability issues"

# Release management
claude-flow agent release-ops "Prepare release v1.2.0 with changelog and deployment"
claude-flow agent build-monitor "Validate production deployment health"
```

## 🔗 Agent Coordination Patterns

### Automatic Agent Spawning
The system automatically selects appropriate agents based on:

1. **Keywords**: "test" → test-agent, "deploy" → release-ops, "security" → security-ops
2. **File patterns**: `*.test.ts` → test-agent, `package.json` → build-monitor
3. **Task complexity**: Multi-step features → sparc-agent coordination
4. **Domain detection**: API changes → development-agent, performance → quality-agent

### Sequential Workflows
Common agent sequences for different task types:

**New Feature (US-XXX):**
```
research-agent → sparc-agent → development-agent → test-agent → quality-agent → github-workflow → release-ops
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
quality-agent → development-agent → test-agent → github-workflow
```

**Security Issue:**
```
security-ops → quality-agent → development-agent → test-agent → release-ops
```

## 📋 Quality Gates & Standards

Each agent enforces specific quality gates:

### Development Standards
- **development-agent**: TypeScript strict mode, React hook stability, clean architecture
- **quality-agent**: >80% test coverage, no code duplication, SOLID principles
- **test-agent**: TDD implementation, comprehensive coverage, fast execution

### Process Standards  
- **sparc-agent**: All phases completed before progression, proper documentation
- **github-workflow**: PR validation, proper branching, documentation updates

### Operations Standards
- **build-monitor**: Clean Docker builds, health check validation, performance metrics
- **security-ops**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, spend within budget, compliance validation
- **release-ops**: Zero-downtime deployments, rollback capability, complete documentation

## 🎓 Educational Approach

All agents follow our educational communication style:
- Explain concepts as if teaching programming fundamentals
- Use simple analogies and friendly language
- Break down complex ideas into digestible pieces
- Celebrate achievements and explain the "why" behind decisions

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Agent Customization
Each agent can be customized through:
- **Tool restrictions**: Limit available tools per security requirements
- **Model selection**: Choose appropriate model (sonnet, haiku) for task complexity
- **Priority levels**: Set coordination priorities for urgent vs. routine tasks

### Environment Integration
Agents automatically adapt to project configuration:
- **Stack detection**: React/Node.js/TypeScript patterns
- **CI/CD integration**: GitHub Actions workflow coordination
- **Deployment patterns**: Docker, staging/production environments

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Agent Effectiveness Tracking
- **Task completion rate**: >95% successful task completion
- **Quality metrics**: Code quality improvements, test coverage increases
- **Time efficiency**: 60% faster development through agent coordination
- **Team satisfaction**: Developer experience and workflow efficiency

### Continuous Improvement
- **Usage analytics**: Track most effective agent combinations
- **Performance optimization**: Improve agent response times and accuracy
- **Feedback integration**: Incorporate developer feedback for agent improvements

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Agent conflicts**: Use sparc-agent for coordination when multiple agents needed
2. **Performance issues**: Monitor build-monitor for system health
3. **Security concerns**: security-ops provides comprehensive monitoring

### Emergency Procedures
- **Critical bugs**: quality-agent → development-agent → test-agent (fast-track)
- **Security incidents**: security-ops immediate response with full team coordination
- **Production issues**: release-ops rollback capabilities with health monitoring
