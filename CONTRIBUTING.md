# Contributing to Universal AI Engineering Handbook

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ascendvent/ai-handbook/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ascendvent/ai-handbook/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Follow the existing code style in the project
* Use meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
* Include appropriate tests for new functionality
* Update documentation as needed

## Testing

Before submitting a PR, make sure to run:

```bash
npm test

## Agent Development Guidelines

When contributing new agents or modifying existing ones:

1. **Follow the agent specification format** used in `/agents/` directory
2. **Include clear documentation** explaining the agent's purpose and usage
3. **Test agent functionality** in realistic development scenarios  
4. **Ensure agents are stack-agnostic** when possible
5. **Follow the educational communication style** outlined in CLAUDE_GLOBAL.md

## Documentation Updates

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
